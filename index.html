              The id in “Id-Driven” refers to Sigmund Freud’s work on psychoanalytic theory of personality. Id is the only component of personality that is present from birth, the most innate and primal aspect of all human behaviours. I have an insatiable hunger to gain more knowledge about technologies revolving especially around web development.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've always enjoyed working with technology and this became more apparent when I learned how to write my own codes. A door to an entirely new world had opened before me and I can see that this is my future. I will enter this new world with the knowledge and skills to create things that will make the world a better place. I wish to take this journey with you!
